    <p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL)</p>

    <header>Why Learn Python</header>
    <article>
    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
    <p>Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:</p>
    </article>
    <article>
    <ul>
      <li>Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

</li>
      <li>Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
      <li>Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
      <li>Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
    </ul>

    <header>Characteristics of Python</header>
    <article>
    <p>Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
        <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
        <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
        <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
        <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
    <header>Hello World</header>
    <article>
    <p>Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program</p>
    <code>print ("Hello, Python!")</code>
      </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="variables">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <article>
    <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
    <p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
      <article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="variable_types">
    <header>Variable Types</header>
    <article>
    <p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>
    <p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example −</p>
      </article>
   <pre> <code class="code">counter = 100  
miles   = 1000.0     
name    = "John"      

print counter
print miles
print name</code></pre>
    <article>
      <p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and "John" are the values assigned to counter, miles, and name variables, respectively. This produces the following result −</p>
      <pre><code class="code">100
1000.0
John</code></pre>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
    <header>Data types</header>
    <article>
      <p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.</p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Python has five standard data types −</h4>
        <li>Numbers</li>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>Tuple</li>
        <li>Dictionary</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="decision_making">
    <header>Decision Making</header>
    <article>
      <p>Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.</p>
      <p>Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.</p>
      <p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages −</p>
      <picture>
        <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/decision_making.jpg" alt="diagram of decision making">
      </picture>
      <p>The if statement contains a logical expression using which data is compared and a decision is made based on the result of the comparison.</p>
      <code class="code">var1 = 100
if var1:
   print "1 - Got a true expression value"
   print var1
</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="loops">
    <header>Loops</header>
        <article>
          <p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>
          <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
          <p>A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.</p>
          <code>while expression:
   statement(s)..</code>
          <h4> Example</h4>
          <code class="code">count = 0
while (count < 9):
   print 'The count is:', count
   count = count + 1

print "Good bye!"</code>
        </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="functions">
    <header>Functions</header>
    <article>
      <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
      <p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h4>Defining a Function</h4>
      <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</li>
        <li>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</li>
        <li>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.</li>
        <li>he code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</li>
        <li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Syntax</h4>
      <code class="code">def functionname( parameters ):
   "function_docstring"
   function_suite
   return [expression]</code>
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <code>def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print str
   return</code>
